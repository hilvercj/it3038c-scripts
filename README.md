## Project 2 Documentation

=======

Some additions to the code for Project 1 were made for Project 2. The additions add a second popup label, telling the user, specificially the student, how many folders and files are in "it3038c-scripts". This is used to determine how much work has been made into the folder, and indirectly how much work the student has done for the class. In order to run the file, right click on the file "project2script.ps1" in the powershell folder, and click "Run in Powershell". The output should be two labels and a table. The table should show the size of the available disks on the computer. The two popups will show the remaining space on disk C:, and then show how many files and folders are in "it3038c-scripts".
